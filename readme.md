This is the Gstudy Project

The final version should include user login along with decks assigned to each user and cards assigned to each deck.

When a deck is selected, a user will be able to view cards one by one and choose whether or not they got the answer correct. This will then increment the score on the card.

A stretch goal will be to add sockets, as well as some style!!
